I want to develop my own blockchain from scratch. It sounds very ambitious but I am going to try something.
## Goal
to create an interface to modify blocks, applying CRUD logic, where all devices involved in the network going to have real time access to what is happening in the blocks's collection 
## Prioritizing
The implementation of design pattern in general, and more specifically **command pattern** or **factory pattern**
